# Job Offer Comparison Website
During our project management class, we learned to use industry standard processes and tools to design, manage, and implement software projects, such as Agile/Scrum sprint planning, minimum viable products, user personas, backlog grooming, Confluence, Jira, and GitHub projects and issues. To gain working experience, we collaborated on a team of four to design and develop a web application that compares job offers using a custom algorithm that considers factors including salary, health insurance, and bonuses, as well as more complex optional items such as stock, relocation costs, and transit expenses.

We started by gathering requirements, competitive analyses, and user personas to brainstorm and prioritize potential features of the application before reducing the list to the most essential requirements needed for the minimum viable product (MVP). We used Confluence to develop project documentation, largely during the design and documentation phase. We then used Jira to break the project up into manageable, connected tasks and plan sprints using an Agile/Scrum approach.

We implemented the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, sharing code and resolving conflicts using Git, using a pull request template file to improve the review process. Although we weren't able to implement every feature we wanted to, this project taught us a lot about software design, industry standard Agile and Scrum processes, and how to prevent scope creep. In addition, we learned to handle merge conflicts, sprint planning, backlog grooming, task estimation using t-shirt sizing, competitive analyses, documentation such as UML and CRD diagrams used to plan the project, and how to come to a consensus on the best design as a group.

To view the website, clone the repo and open the public folder in your browser. Click **Start As Guest**, then **Enter Manually**. Review the form, toggling **More Options** as desired. To prevent testers from having to fill out the form over and over, we chose to have example offers automatically compared when **Submit** is clicked. You will see a color coded chart as well as a ranking of the three example offers.
