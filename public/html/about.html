                    <strong>The Job Evaluation Tool</strong> is a web-based platform designed to help users analyze and compare multiple job offers, focusing on compensation packages such as salary, benefits, stock options, and bonuses. Accessible via any web browser, it allows users to compare offers directly, with transparent evaluations and rankings based on personal preferences. 
                        
                        Key features include uploading job offers in PDF format, links to external career coaching and salary comparison tools, and clear explanations of compensation terms to help users better understand their offers. 
                        
                        The platform includes a user profile system that saves preferences, supports customizable ranking criteria, and provides insights into taxes, take-home pay, and stock options. It also features charts and graphs for visual comparisons, and allows users to save and print their analysis as a PDF.
